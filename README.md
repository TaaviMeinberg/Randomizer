## Initialization
To initialize this project, clone this repository in Your Android Studio.

## Tutorial
This app was made using this tutorial:

[![Tutorial Link](http://img.youtube.com/vi/EOfCEhWq8sg/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOfCEhWq8sg)

The tutorial does a great job at conveying the basic concepts of Android Studio, while not overloading the viewer with coding specifics.

The presentation is fast, clear and easily followed. The creation of the layout is kept simple by using the drag & drop method, which allows the author visually convey the connections between the different widgets.
Overall, I r8 8/8 m8.

## Specifics
Disclaimer: this application was developed and tested on Android 9.0 (Pie), running it on an earlier version might cause unintended conflicts.

## Future features
Most of this application matches the tutorial, with the addition of the little text that shows the currently selected progressBar value. The application currently fulfills it's objective, which is to show a randomly generated number in a certain range.

Additional feature could be allowing the user to set the max value that the progressBar can have (currently it is hard-coded to 10).
